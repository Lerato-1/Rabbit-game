# Simple Rabbit Game

Welcome to the **Simple Rabbit Game** repository! In this game, you control a rabbit that needs to jump over obstacles and avoid being caught. The goal is to survive as long as possible while scoring points for each successful jump. This is a fun and simple project I created to practice basic game development concepts.

## Game Overview

The rabbit runs automatically, and your goal is to make the rabbit jump over obstacles. Each time the rabbit successfully jumps over an obstacle, you earn points. If the rabbit hits an obstacle, the game ends.

### Features:
- **Endless gameplay**: The rabbit continuously runs, and new obstacles appear at regular intervals.
- **Jump mechanics**: The rabbit can jump to avoid obstacles.
- **Scoring**: The game keeps track of your score, which increases each time you successfully jump over an obstacle.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the rabbit hits an obstacle.
